0.3.2
-----
* remove an extra `%` from the redirect view

0.3.1
-----
* update authentication code for upcoming chrome changes.

0.3.0
-----
* Remove sinatra-twitter-bootstrap dependency. Include css from cdn directly for example app.

0.2.0
-----
* added a SHOPIFY_REDIRECT_URI env param for setting the redirect_uri (was breifly HOSTNAME)
* add versions to gemfile
* refactored the generator
* Changed install method to after_shopify_auth. Implementations of this method must now be idempotent as this will be called anytime the app is auth'd which may be due to just a lost session and not necessarily an install.
* Always redo the full auth rather than trying to keep track of first time install state vs re-auth
